### Using temporal acoustic features to predict which songs will be liked among those recommended by Spotify 

This project uses the extracted audio analysis from Spotify tracks. Several tracks recommended by Spotify for a specific user were segregated into separate "liked" and "rejected" playlists. Various machine learning models were trained using the temporal acoustic features from the various tracks to determine if a model could learn a user's musical preferences by accurately predicting new recommendations as being "liked" or "rejected" by the user.
